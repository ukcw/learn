# learn

I've always wanted to have an open repository for learning new things. I think
learning in public is a good way to keep myself accountable and to keep track
of my progress.

Having a repository for learning helps me to aggregate all the different topics
I learn in one place and it is easy for me to refer back to these notes and projects.
